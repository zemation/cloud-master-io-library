It is designed for large-scale, high-performance, and cost-effective analytics on data stored in Google Cloud Storage, and is ideal for business intelligence, data exploration, and ad-hoc reporting.

Here are some best practices for using BigQuery on Google Cloud Platform:
- Use partitioning and clustering: BigQuery allows you to partition and cluster your tables, which can improve query performance and reduce costs. Partitioning divides the table into smaller, more manageable pieces, while clustering sorts the data within each partition based on one or more columns. This allows for more efficient filtering and reduces the amount of data scanned.
- Use column-based storage: BigQuery uses a columnar storage format, which is optimized for analytical queries. This means that only the columns needed for a query are scanned, rather than the entire row. As a result, queries run faster and cost less.
- Optimize data ingestion: BigQuery supports batch and streaming data ingestion. When ingesting large amounts of data, batch loading is usually more cost-effective. However, for real-time use cases, streaming ingestion may be necessary. To reduce costs, consider batching small amounts of data together rather than streaming each event individually.
- Control access to data: Use BigQuery's access controls to limit who can access and modify your data. Use roles and permissions to grant access to specific datasets, tables, or views. Implementing strong security measures will help protect your data and prevent unauthorized access.
- Monitor and optimize costs: BigQuery pricing is based on the amount of data processed, so it's important to monitor your usage and optimize your queries to minimize costs. Use BigQuery's cost analysis tools to identify queries that are consuming the most resources and optimize them. Additionally, consider setting up billing alerts to notify you when costs reach a certain threshold.
- Use caching: BigQuery provides a caching mechanism that can improve query performance and reduce costs. When a query is executed, BigQuery checks to see if the results are already in the cache. If they are, the query is served from the cache, which can be faster and cheaper than re-executing the query. However, be aware that caching can consume storage and increase costs.
- Consider using BI tools: BigQuery integrates with many popular business intelligence (BI) tools, such as Tableau, Looker, and Data Studio. These tools provide a more user-friendly interface for querying and visualizing data, and can help simplify complex queries.
- Use best practices for data modeling: When designing your data schema, follow best practices for data modeling to ensure optimal query performance. Use denormalized data structures, avoid excessive joins, and optimize data types to reduce storage and processing costs.
- Use query optimization techniques: BigQuery provides many optimization techniques to improve query performance. Use the EXPLAIN command to understand how a query is executed and identify potential performance bottlenecks. Use query optimization features such as JOIN and GROUP BY to minimize data processing.
- Monitor and tune performance: Use BigQuery's monitoring tools to track query performance and identify slow-running queries. Use the Query Plan and Execution Details to identify performance bottlenecks and optimize queries. Regularly review and optimize your queries to ensure optimal performance and minimize costs.
