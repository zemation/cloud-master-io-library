## Setting up cloud projects and accounts
### Google Cloud Platform Resource Hierarchy

Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is a cloud computing platform that provides a wide range of services and solutions to help organizations build and run their applications and services. The cloud hierarchy of the GCP is a logical organization of resources that allows you to manage and control access to your resources.

The cloud hierarchy of GCP can be organized into the following levels:

Organization: The top-level entity in the GCP hierarchy is the Organization, which represents the highest level of management and control over your resources. An organization can contain multiple folders and projects, and is typically used to manage access control, policies, and billing for all the resources in your GCP environment.

Folder: A Folder is a logical container within an Organization that allows you to group related resources together. Folders provide a way to manage access control and policies at a more granular level than the Organization level, while still providing centralized management and control.

Project: A Project is a container for resources that allows you to manage and organize your GCP resources. Each Project has its own set of resources, such as compute instances, storage buckets, and networking resources. Projects provide a way to manage access control and billing for a specific set of resources, and can be organized into Folders for better management.

Resource: A Resource is a GCP service that provides a specific functionality, such as a virtual machine, a storage bucket, or a database. Resources can be created, managed, and deleted within a Project, and can be organized into groups or clusters for better management and control.

The cloud hierarchy of GCP provides a flexible and scalable way to manage your resources, with granular access control, policies, and billing for each level. By using this hierarchy, you can effectively manage your GCP resources and optimize your costs and performance.

### Applying organizational policies the resource hierarchy
In the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), organizational policies are applied at the top-level entity of the GCP hierarchy, which is the Organization level. Organizational policies allow you to define and enforce rules and restrictions for your GCP resources across all projects and folders within the organization.

Organizational policies are defined using the Google Cloud Console or the Cloud SDK, and are enforced by the GCP Policy Controller. The Policy Controller evaluates policies against all the resources in the organization, and ensures that they comply with the defined policies.

Organizational policies can be applied in the following ways:

Inheritance: Policies can be inherited from the parent organization to the child folders and projects. This allows you to define a policy once at the Organization level and have it automatically apply to all the child resources.

Overrides: Policies can be overridden at the child level to provide more granular control. This allows you to define a policy at the Organization level, but still provide exceptions or different policies for specific folders or projects.

Constraints: Policies can be defined as constraints, which are rules that must be followed when creating or modifying resources in the organization. Constraints allow you to enforce specific policies on resources at the time of creation or modification.

Organizational policies can be used to enforce security, compliance, and governance requirements across your GCP resources. By using organizational policies, you can ensure that your resources comply with your organization's policies and regulations, and reduce the risk of security incidents or compliance violations.

### Member IAM Roles in a project
In the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), Identity and Access Management (IAM) allows you to manage access to your resources by defining roles and assigning them to members. A member can be a user, a group, or a service account, and a role determines the level of access that a member has to the GCP resources.

There are three types of member roles in GCP IAM:

Primitive roles: Primitive roles are the basic roles that come pre-defined in GCP IAM. These roles provide basic permissions for managing resources, such as Viewer, Editor, and Owner. Primitive roles are not recommended for production environments, as they provide blanket access to all resources within a project.

Predefined roles: Predefined roles are roles that are defined by GCP and provide a specific set of permissions for a particular GCP service. These roles can be assigned to members at the project, folder, or organization level, and can be used to grant access to specific resources within a project.

Custom roles: Custom roles are roles that you define yourself to provide more granular access control for your GCP resources. Custom roles allow you to specify exactly which permissions a member should have for a particular resource, and can be assigned at the project, folder, or organization level.

Members can have multiple roles assigned to them, and the permissions of each role are combined to determine the level of access a member has to the GCP resources. Members can be added, removed, or edited at any time, and their access to resources will be updated accordingly.

By using member roles in GCP IAM, you can ensure that each member has the appropriate level of access to your GCP resources, and that access is controlled and monitored according to your organization's policies and regulations.

### Managing users and groups in Cloud Identity (manually and automated)
Cloud Identity is a cloud-based identity and access management service that allows you to manage users, groups, and devices in your organization. Managing users and groups in Cloud Identity can be done manually or through automated methods.

Manual user and group management: In Cloud Identity, you can manually create, modify, and delete users and groups using the Google Admin Console. To create a user, you can provide their name, email address, and other details, and assign them to the appropriate groups and roles. To create a group, you can provide the group name, description, and members, and assign them the appropriate access and permissions. You can also modify and delete users and groups as needed, and manage their access to resources and services.

Automated user and group management: Cloud Identity also provides several automated methods for managing users and groups, including:

Directory synchronization: This method allows you to synchronize your on-premises directory with Cloud Identity, so that changes made in your on-premises directory are automatically reflected in Cloud Identity.

API-based provisioning: This method allows you to use APIs to programmatically create, modify, and delete users and groups in Cloud Identity.

SCIM-based provisioning: This method allows you to use the System for Cross-domain Identity Management (SCIM) standard to automate the provisioning and deprovisioning of users and groups in Cloud Identity.

Automated user and group management can help you streamline your identity and access management processes, reduce errors, and ensure consistency across your organization's user and group management practices.

Regardless of the method you choose, it is important to establish and follow best practices for managing users and groups in Cloud Identity, such as regularly reviewing and updating user and group access and permissions, enforcing strong password policies, and monitoring user activity and security events.

### APIs in Google Cloud and enabling them
In the Google Cloud Platform (GCP), APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide a way for developers to interact with GCP services and resources programmatically. APIs allow developers to automate tasks, build custom applications, and integrate GCP services with other applications and systems.

To enable APIs in GCP, you need to follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console: Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/ and sign in to your GCP account.
2. Navigate to the API Library: Click on the hamburger menu (â˜°) in the upper left corner of the Console, and select "APIs & Services" > "Library".
3. Find the API you want to enable: In the Library, you can search for the API you want to enable, or browse the available APIs by category.
4. Enable the API: Once you find the API you want to enable, click on its name to go to the API page, and click the "Enable" button to enable the API.

Set up API access: Depending on the API, you may need to set up access credentials, such as API keys or OAuth 2.0 credentials, to authenticate requests to the API.

Once the API is enabled and you have set up the necessary credentials, you can start using the API to interact with GCP services and resources programmatically.

GCP offers a wide range of APIs for different services and resources, including Compute Engine, Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and many others. Each API has its own documentation, which provides details on how to use the API, including API endpoints, request and response formats, and authentication methods.

In addition to the GCP Console, you can also enable APIs programmatically using the Cloud SDK or the GCP API. By using these methods, you can automate the process of enabling and managing APIs in your GCP projects.
