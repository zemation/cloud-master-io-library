## Deploying and implementing Compute Engine resources
Compute Engine is one of the core services offered by Google Cloud Platform that provides virtual machines (VMs) on demand. It is a scalable and high-performance computing infrastructure that allows users to launch virtual machines in the cloud with various operating systems and pre-installed software.

Compute Engine offers a variety of machine types, ranging from small to high-performance, to meet the specific needs of applications. It also provides options to customize machine images, persistent disks, and network configurations, allowing users to tailor their virtual machines to specific requirements.

Compute Engine offers several features to enhance the security and reliability of virtual machines, such as automatic backups, live migration, and integrated firewall rules. It also provides support for load balancing and auto-scaling to ensure optimal performance and availability.

Compute Engine can be accessed through the Google Cloud Console, command-line tools, or APIs, making it easy to manage and configure virtual machines. It also offers integration with other Google Cloud Platform services, such as Cloud Storage, BigQuery, and Kubernetes Engine, enabling users to build and deploy scalable applications in the cloud.

Here are some best practices for deploying and implementing compute engine resources in Google Cloud Platform:
- Use instance templates: Instance templates allow you to specify a machine configuration once and then use that configuration to create multiple instances. This can save time and reduce the risk of configuration errors.
- Use managed instance groups: Managed instance groups allow you to automatically manage and scale groups of instances. They can automatically add or remove instances based on traffic or other metrics.
- Use load balancers: Load balancers can help distribute traffic across multiple instances, improving performance and reliability. Use HTTP(S) load balancing for HTTP and HTTPS traffic, and use network load balancing for non-HTTP traffic.
- Use preemptible VMs for non-critical workloads: Preemptible VMs are available at a lower price than regular VMs, but they can be shut down at any time. Use them for non-critical workloads that can tolerate interruptions.
- Use custom machine types: Custom machine types allow you to create a machine with a specific number of vCPUs and memory. This can help optimize performance and reduce costs.
- Use SSD persistent disks: SSD persistent disks are faster than standard persistent disks and can improve performance for disk-intensive workloads.
- Use snapshots for backup and disaster recovery: Take regular snapshots of your disks to create a backup and disaster recovery plan. You can restore from a snapshot to recover data in case of a failure.
- Use auto-scaling: Auto-scaling allows you to automatically adjust the number of instances based on traffic or other metrics. This can help improve performance and reduce costs.
- Use Cloud Storage for data storage: Cloud Storage is a scalable and cost-effective solution for storing data in the cloud. Use it to store data that needs to be accessed frequently or infrequently.
- Use labels for resource organization: Labels allow you to add metadata to your resources and can be used for resource organization and management. Use them to help you quickly identify and manage your resources.

### Creating an autoscaled managed instance group using a template
In Google Cloud Platform, a managed instance group (MIG) is a collection of virtual machine (VM) instances that are managed as a single entity. The group can be automatically scaled up or down based on the needs of the application workload, and it can be used to provide high availability and fault tolerance.

To create an autoscaled managed instance group using an instance template in Google Cloud Platform, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance template: In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the Compute Engine section and create an instance template that defines the configuration of your VM instances. This template will be used by the MIG to create and manage the VM instances.
2. Configure the managed instance group: In the same Compute Engine section, create a managed instance group and configure it to use the instance template you created. You can set the minimum and maximum number of instances in the group and specify the autoscaling policies.
3. Configure autoscaling: Configure the autoscaling policies by setting the CPU utilization target or other metrics such as the number of requests per second. You can also set the cooldown period and other parameters.
4. Test the managed instance group: Once the MIG is created and configured, you can test it by sending traffic to the instances and monitoring the autoscaling behavior. You can also perform rolling updates and other maintenance tasks on the instances.

By following these steps, you can create an autoscaled managed instance group using an instance template in Google Cloud Platform. The MIG can automatically scale up or down based on the needs of the application workload, and it can provide high availability and fault tolerance.

### Generating/uploading a custom SSH key for instances

You can generate and upload a custom SSH key for instances in Google Cloud Platform using the following steps:

1. Generate an SSH key pair: On your local computer, generate an SSH key pair using a tool such as ssh-keygen. This will create a public key and a private key.
2. Copy the public key: Copy the contents of the public key file, typically ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub, to the clipboard.
3. Add the public key to the metadata of the project: In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the Metadata section of the Compute Engine instance that you want to connect to using SSH. Add a new SSH key by pasting the contents of the public key file into the text box.
4. Connect to the instance using SSH: Once the key is uploaded to the metadata, you can connect to the instance using SSH from your local computer by specifying the private key file with the -i option. For example, to connect to an instance with IP address 1.2.3.4, use the command ssh -i ~/.ssh/private_key user@1.2.3.4.

By following these steps, you can generate and upload a custom SSH key for instances in Google Cloud Platform, and use it to connect to the instances securely using SSH.

Here are some best practices for generating and using SSH keys for compute instances in Google Cloud Platform:
- Generate SSH keys locally: It's recommended to generate SSH keys locally rather than on a remote server. This is because local key pairs can be easily secured and managed, reducing the risk of unauthorized access.
- Use strong passwords for passphrase: When generating an SSH key pair, you can optionally set a passphrase for added security. It's important to use a strong password and to avoid using the same password for multiple accounts.
- Use different SSH keys for different accounts: To enhance security, use different SSH keys for different accounts, and avoid sharing keys between accounts.
- Restrict SSH access: To minimize the risk of unauthorized access, restrict SSH access to only authorized users, and limit the IP addresses that can connect to your instances.
- Disable password-based SSH access: It's recommended to disable password-based SSH access and only use SSH key authentication. This helps prevent brute-force attacks and other security risks associated with passwords.
- Rotate SSH keys regularly: To reduce the risk of compromised keys, it's good practice to rotate SSH keys on a regular basis, especially if you suspect that a key may have been compromised.
- Monitor SSH logs: Monitor SSH logs for suspicious activity, such as repeated failed login attempts, to identify potential security threats.
- Use Google Cloud Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP): Google Cloud IAP allows you to secure SSH access to your instances by using identity and context-based access controls instead of using IP-based access controls. It also allows you to grant access to specific users or groups based on their identity and role.

Overall, following these best practices can help ensure the security of your compute instances and reduce the risk of unauthorized access.

### Installing and configuring the Cloud Monitoring and Logging Agent

Cloud Monitoring and Logging Agent are two different agents used to collect metrics and logs respectively from VM instances and other resources in Google Cloud Platform.

Cloud Monitoring Agent is responsible for collecting system and application metrics from your virtual machine (VM) instances, on-premises servers, and other resources, and sending them to Cloud Monitoring. Cloud Logging Agent collects and exports log data from your VM instances, other resources, and applications, to Cloud Logging.

Here are the steps to install and configure Cloud Monitoring and Logging agents on a VM instance:

1. Install the agent: Install the agent by running the appropriate command for your operating system. For example, on a Debian-based system, you can use the command: sudo apt-get install stackdriver-agent.
2. Configure the agent: After installing the agent, configure it to collect the metrics or logs you want. This is done by editing the agent's configuration file, which is usually located in /etc/stackdriver/. The exact file name may depend on the agent version and operating system.
3. Restart the agent: After making changes to the agent's configuration, restart the agent to apply the changes. You can do this using the command: sudo service stackdriver-agent restart.
4. Verify the agent is collecting data: Finally, verify that the agent is collecting the metrics or logs you want by checking the Cloud Monitoring or Cloud Logging interface.

By following these steps, you can install and configure Cloud Monitoring and Logging agents on a VM instance in Google Cloud Platform, and start collecting system and application metrics as well as logs from your resources.

Google Cloud Monitoring and Logging agents provide a convenient way to gather and analyze system and application metrics in Google Cloud Platform. Here are some best practices for using these agents:

- Install agents on all VM instances: To get the most complete view of your system and application performance, install the monitoring and logging agents on all VM instances running in your project.
- Use the most recent version of agents: To ensure the best compatibility and support, use the most recent version of the monitoring and logging agents.
- Keep agents up-to-date: Set up a regular schedule to update the agents to the latest version to take advantage of new features and bug fixes.
- Enable custom metrics: Use custom metrics to track application-specific metrics that are not captured by default system metrics.
- Define monitoring and alerting policies: Define appropriate monitoring and alerting policies to receive notifications when metrics go beyond pre-defined thresholds.
- Filter logs and metrics: To avoid unnecessary clutter, filter logs and metrics by severity, source, or other criteria.
- Use structured logging: Use structured logging to allow for easier search, analysis, and filtering of log data.
- Manage log retention: Manage log retention and archiving policies to balance cost and the need to retain data for compliance or troubleshooting purposes.
- Use log sinks: Use log sinks to export logs to external systems, such as BigQuery or on-premises infrastructure, for further analysis and long-term storage.
- Monitor agent performance: Monitor agent performance to ensure they are not impacting system performance and to identify any issues early on.

Overall, it is important to configure and use monitoring and logging agents appropriately to ensure timely detection and resolution of issues, efficient use of resources, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
