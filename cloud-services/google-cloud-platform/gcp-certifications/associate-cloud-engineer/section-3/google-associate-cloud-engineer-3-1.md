### Creating an autoscaled managed instance group using a template
In Google Cloud Platform, a managed instance group (MIG) is a collection of virtual machine (VM) instances that are managed as a single entity. The group can be automatically scaled up or down based on the needs of the application workload, and it can be used to provide high availability and fault tolerance.

To create an autoscaled managed instance group using an instance template in Google Cloud Platform, follow these steps:

1. Create an instance template: In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the Compute Engine section and create an instance template that defines the configuration of your VM instances. This template will be used by the MIG to create and manage the VM instances.
2. Configure the managed instance group: In the same Compute Engine section, create a managed instance group and configure it to use the instance template you created. You can set the minimum and maximum number of instances in the group and specify the autoscaling policies.
3. Configure autoscaling: Configure the autoscaling policies by setting the CPU utilization target or other metrics such as the number of requests per second. You can also set the cooldown period and other parameters.
4. Test the managed instance group: Once the MIG is created and configured, you can test it by sending traffic to the instances and monitoring the autoscaling behavior. You can also perform rolling updates and other maintenance tasks on the instances.

By following these steps, you can create an autoscaled managed instance group using an instance template in Google Cloud Platform. The MIG can automatically scale up or down based on the needs of the application workload, and it can provide high availability and fault tolerance.

### Generating/uploading a custom SSH key for instances

You can generate and upload a custom SSH key for instances in Google Cloud Platform using the following steps:

1. Generate an SSH key pair: On your local computer, generate an SSH key pair using a tool such as ssh-keygen. This will create a public key and a private key.
2. Copy the public key: Copy the contents of the public key file, typically ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub or ~/.ssh/id_dsa.pub, to the clipboard.
3. Add the public key to the metadata of the project: In the Google Cloud Console, navigate to the Metadata section of the Compute Engine instance that you want to connect to using SSH. Add a new SSH key by pasting the contents of the public key file into the text box.
4. Connect to the instance using SSH: Once the key is uploaded to the metadata, you can connect to the instance using SSH from your local computer by specifying the private key file with the -i option. For example, to connect to an instance with IP address 1.2.3.4, use the command ssh -i ~/.ssh/private_key user@1.2.3.4.

By following these steps, you can generate and upload a custom SSH key for instances in Google Cloud Platform, and use it to connect to the instances securely using SSH.

### Installing and configuring the Cloud Monitoring and Logging Agent

Cloud Monitoring and Logging Agent are two different agents used to collect metrics and logs respectively from VM instances and other resources in Google Cloud Platform.

Cloud Monitoring Agent is responsible for collecting system and application metrics from your virtual machine (VM) instances, on-premises servers, and other resources, and sending them to Cloud Monitoring. Cloud Logging Agent collects and exports log data from your VM instances, other resources, and applications, to Cloud Logging.

Here are the steps to install and configure Cloud Monitoring and Logging agents on a VM instance:

1. Install the agent: Install the agent by running the appropriate command for your operating system. For example, on a Debian-based system, you can use the command: sudo apt-get install stackdriver-agent.
2. Configure the agent: After installing the agent, configure it to collect the metrics or logs you want. This is done by editing the agent's configuration file, which is usually located in /etc/stackdriver/. The exact file name may depend on the agent version and operating system.
3. Restart the agent: After making changes to the agent's configuration, restart the agent to apply the changes. You can do this using the command: sudo service stackdriver-agent restart.
4. Verify the agent is collecting data: Finally, verify that the agent is collecting the metrics or logs you want by checking the Cloud Monitoring or Cloud Logging interface.

By following these steps, you can install and configure Cloud Monitoring and Logging agents on a VM instance in Google Cloud Platform, and start collecting system and application metrics as well as logs from your resources.
