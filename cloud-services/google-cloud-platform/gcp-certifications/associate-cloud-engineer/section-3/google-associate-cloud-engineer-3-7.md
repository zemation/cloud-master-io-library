## Implementing resources via infrastructure as code.
### Building infrastructure via Cloud Foundation Toolkit templates and implementing best practices

Infrastructure as code (IaC) is a method of managing and provisioning cloud resources in an automated and programmable way using code instead of manual configuration. In Google Cloud Platform, IaC can be achieved using several tools such as Deployment Manager, Terraform, and Cloud SDK (gcloud).

With IaC, infrastructure can be defined and managed as code, which allows for faster and more reliable provisioning of resources. It also enables version control, collaboration, and testing of infrastructure changes before they are deployed to production.

Infrastructure as code tools allow users to write code to define and manage resources such as virtual machines, containers, load balancers, and networks. This code can be versioned, reviewed, tested, and deployed using continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) practices.

Using IaC in Google Cloud Platform, users can create, update, and delete resources in an automated and repeatable way. This can save time, reduce errors, and improve overall infrastructure management.

Google Cloud Foundation is a set of best practices and tools provided by Google Cloud Platform to help organizations establish a solid foundation for their cloud infrastructure. It includes recommended architectures, security controls, resource hierarchies, and other configurations that are optimized for scalability, performance, and cost-effectiveness.

Google Cloud Foundation also includes tools like Cloud Deployment Manager, Terraform, and Google Cloud Console that help automate the creation and management of infrastructure as code. This allows organizations to quickly provision and scale resources while maintaining consistency and compliance across their entire infrastructure. By using Google Cloud Foundation, organizations can reduce the time and resources required to build and manage their cloud environments, freeing up resources to focus on innovation and business growth.

The Cloud Foundation Toolkit provides various tools for cloud infrastructure management, including:

Terraform: An open-source infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define and manage cloud resources in a declarative manner.

Deployment Manager: A Google Cloud-specific infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define and manage cloud resources using templates.

Config Connector: An open-source Kubernetes add-on that allows you to manage Google Cloud resources using Kubernetes YAML files.

Service Directory: A cloud-based service registry that allows you to register and discover services across your infrastructure.

Policy Library: A collection of pre-built policies and policy templates that allows you to enforce governance and compliance across your cloud infrastructure.

Cloud Asset Inventory: A tool that allows you to view and analyze your cloud resources in a unified way.

Forseti Security: A tool that provides security and compliance monitoring and enforcement across your Google Cloud infrastructure.

Monitoring and Logging: Tools for monitoring and logging, such as Cloud Monitoring and Cloud Logging, to help you gain insights and visibility into your cloud infrastructure.

Overall, the Google Cloud Foundation toolkit helps organizations manage their cloud infrastructure more effectively and efficiently by providing a set of integrated tools and services for infrastructure management, governance, and security.


### Installing and configuring Config Connector in Google Kubernetes Engine to create, update, delete, and secure resources

Config Connector is a Kubernetes add-on that allows users to manage and control Google Cloud resources through Kubernetes using the Kubernetes API. It enables the use of Kubernetes-style declarative configuration for managing and deploying Google Cloud resources, such as Compute Engine VMs, Cloud Storage buckets, Cloud SQL databases, and more.

With Config Connector, users can create, update, and delete Google Cloud resources using Kubernetes manifests and tools, instead of using the Google Cloud Console or SDK. This provides a more streamlined and consistent approach to managing infrastructure across Google Cloud and Kubernetes environments.

Config Connector works by deploying controllers within Kubernetes that translate Kubernetes API objects into Google Cloud API calls. This allows users to interact with Google Cloud resources in the same way they interact with Kubernetes objects, using the same tools and workflows they are already familiar with.

Overall, Config Connector simplifies the process of managing cloud resources, eliminates the need to switch between multiple tools and interfaces, and enables a more efficient and scalable approach to managing infrastructure on Google Cloud.

To install and configure Config Connector in Google Kubernetes Engine, follow these steps:
1. Create a new Google Cloud project or use an existing one.
2. Enable the Config Connector API in your Google Cloud project by going to the Google Cloud Console and navigating to the API & Services section.
3. Install and configure the Google Cloud SDK by following the instructions in the official documentation.
4. Install and configure kubectl, the Kubernetes command-line tool, by following the instructions in the official documentation.
5. Create a Google Cloud service account with the necessary permissions to manage resources in your Kubernetes cluster.
6. Create a Kubernetes secret with the credentials for the service account by running the following command:

<pre><code>
kubectl create secret generic {secret-name} --from-file={path-to-key-file}
</code></pre>
Replace {secret-name} with the name you want to give the secret and {path-to-key-file> with the path to the service account key file.

7. Install Config Connector in your Kubernetes cluster by running the following command:

<pre><code>
kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/config-connector-operator/latest/release-bundle.yaml
</code></pre>

Create a Config Connector installation by running the following command:
<pre><code>
kubectl apply -f https://storage.googleapis.com/config-connector/versions/{version}/examples/installer/installer.yaml
</code></pre>

8. Replace {version} with the version of Config Connector you want to install.

9. Configure Config Connector by creating a ConfigMap with the necessary configuration. An example configuration file is provided in the official documentation.

10. Deploy your resources using the YAML configuration files in your Kubernetes cluster. Config Connector will automatically create, update, and delete resources as necessary based on the configuration files.

By following these steps, you can install and configure Config Connector in Google Kubernetes Engine to manage resources using YAML configuration files.
