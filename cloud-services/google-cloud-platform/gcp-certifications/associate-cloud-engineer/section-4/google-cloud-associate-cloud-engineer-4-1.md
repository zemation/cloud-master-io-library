</code></pre>
7. Verify that the GPU is detected and working correctly by running the following command:
<pre><code>
nvidia-smi
</code></pre>
This will display information about the installed GPU, such as its memory usage and processes running on it.

Once you have completed these steps, your instance will be configured to use the GPU accelerator, and you can run any applications or workloads that require GPU acceleration.

### Viewing current running VM inventory (instance IDs, details)
To view the current running VM inventory, including instance IDs and other details, you can use the Google Cloud Console or the gcloud command-line tool. Here are the steps:

Using the Google Cloud Console:

1. Open the Cloud Console in your web browser and navigate to the Compute Engine section.
2. You will see a list of all the running instances in your project, including their names, zones, machine types, and other details.

Using the gcloud command-line tool:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have installed and configured the gcloud command-line tool.
2. Run the following command to list all the running instances in your project:
<pre><code>
gcloud compute instances list
</code></pre>
This command will display a table of all the instances in your project, including their instance IDs, names, zones, machine types, and status.

You can also use various flags with the 'gcloud compute instances list' command to filter the output, sort the results, and display only specific columns. For example, you can use the '--filter' flag to display only instances with a specific name, or the '--format' flag to display only the instance IDs.

Once you have retrieved the inventory of running VM instances, you can use this information to monitor, manage, and perform other operations on the instances as needed.

### Working with snapshots (e.g., create a snapshot from a VM, view snapshots, delete a snapshot)
In Google Cloud Platform, a VM snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a virtual machine (VM) instance's persistent disk. It captures the state of the disk, including the operating system, application data, and configurations, at a specific moment, and can be used to create a new disk or restore a disk to a previous state.

Snapshots are an efficient way to backup VM instances and protect against data loss due to system failures or accidental deletion. They are stored as differential images, which means that only the changes since the last snapshot are stored, reducing storage costs and minimizing the time needed to create and restore snapshots.

Google Cloud Platform provides a number of tools for creating and managing snapshots, including the Cloud Console, the gcloud command-line tool, and the API. You can create a snapshot manually, or set up automatic snapshot policies that create snapshots on a regular schedule. You can also use snapshots to create new disks or restore disks from a previous state.

Snapshots are a useful feature in Google Cloud Platform, and can help you ensure that your data is protected against loss or corruption.

Once you have confirmed the deletion, the snapshot will be permanently removed and cannot be recovered. Therefore, make sure that you have backed up any important data before deleting a snapshot.

###  Working with images (e.g., create an image from a VM or a snapshot, view images, delete an image)
In Google Cloud Platform, a VM image is a template for creating virtual machine (VM) instances. It contains the information needed to launch a new VM, including the operating system, software packages, libraries, and other configurations. When you create a new VM instance, you can use a pre-existing VM image as a base and customize it as needed.

There are two types of VM images in Google Cloud Platform:

- Public images: These are pre-built VM images that are provided by Google or third-party vendors, and are available to all GCP users. They can be used to quickly spin up new VM instances with common operating systems and applications.

- Custom images: These are user-created VM images that can be customized with specific configurations, software packages, and data. They can be used to create consistent environments for development, testing, and production workloads.

VM images are stored in Google Cloud Storage buckets, and can be shared across projects and organizations. They can also be exported and imported in a variety of formats, such as OVF or VHD.

You can create VM images from existing VM instances, create them from scratch using a boot disk or an existing image, and manage them using the Cloud Console, the gcloud command-line tool, or the API. By using VM images, you can easily create and manage VM instances in Google Cloud Platform, and ensure that they are configured and secured according to your requirements.

### Creating a VM image from existing VM or snapshot

4. In the "Create a custom image" page, enter a name and description for the new image.
5. In the "Source" section, select either "Disk" or "Snapshot" as the source type, and choose the disk or snapshot that you want to use as the source.
6. Choose the desired options for encryption, labels, and network tags.
7. Click on the "Create" button to create the new VM image.

#### Using the gcloud command-line tool:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have installed and configured the gcloud command-line tool.
2. Run the following command to create a new VM image from a disk:

<pre><code>
gcloud compute images create IMAGE_NAME --source-disk DISK_NAME --source-disk-zone ZONE
</code></pre>
Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name that you want to give the new image, DISK_NAME with the name of the disk that you want to use as the source, and ZONE with the name of the zone where the disk is located.

3. Alternatively, you can create a new VM image from a snapshot by running the following command:
<pre><code>
gcloud compute images create IMAGE_NAME --source-snapshot SNAPSHOT_NAME --source-snapshot-project PROJECT_ID
</code></pre>
Replace SNAPSHOT_NAME with the name of the snapshot that you want to use as the source, PROJECT_ID with the ID of the project where the snapshot is located, and IMAGE_NAME with the name that you want to give the new image.

4. You can also specify additional options, such as the image family or the encryption keys, using flags such as --family or --storage-location.

Once you have created the new VM image, you can use it to launch new VM instances in Google Cloud Platform.

### Deleting an image 
You can view your existing images in Google Cloud Platform using the Cloud Console or the gcloud command-line tool. Here are the general steps for each method:

#### Using the Cloud Console:

4. You can also run the following command to view the details of a specific image:

<pre><code>
gcloud compute images describe IMAGE_NAME
</code></pre>
Replace IMAGE_NAME with the name of the image that you want to view.

Once you have located the image that you need, you can use it to create new VM instances, manage permissions, or export it to other formats.

### Working with instance groups (e.g., set autoscaling parameters, assign instance template, create an instance template, remove instance group)
In Google Cloud Platform, an instance group is a logical grouping of one or more virtual machine (VM) instances that allows you to manage them collectively as a single entity. An instance group can be either a managed instance group or an unmanaged instance group.

A managed instance group is a group of identical VM instances that are created and managed by a managed instance group manager. The manager automatically creates and scales instances based on the current load, monitors the health of instances, and applies updates and patches to instances as needed. Managed instance groups can be used for autoscaling, load balancing, and rolling out deployments.

An unmanaged instance group is a group of individual VM instances that are not managed by an instance group manager. You can create and delete instances manually, but you are responsible for monitoring the health of instances, applying updates and patches, and ensuring that the group remains in a desired state. Unmanaged instance groups can be used for simple horizontal scaling and failover scenarios.

Instance groups can be used with other Google Cloud services, such as load balancers, health checks, and autohealing, to provide highly available and scalable applications. You can create instance groups from new or existing VM instances, and you can customize the group's size, template, autohealing policies, and other settings as needed.

#### Set autoscaling parameters
To set autoscaling parameters for instance groups in Google Cloud Platform, you can use the Cloud Console, the gcloud command-line tool, or the Google Cloud API. Here are the general steps:

#### Using the Cloud Console:
1. Open the Google Cloud Console in your web browser and navigate to the instance group that you want to configure autoscaling for.
2. Click on the "Autoscaling" tab to open the autoscaling configuration page.
3. Set the minimum and maximum number of instances that you want the group to have.
4. Choose the metric that you want to use for autoscaling, such as CPU utilization, HTTP load balancing traffic, or Stackdriver Monitoring metrics.
5. Set the target utilization level for the metric, which determines when the group should scale up or down.
6. Choose the autoscaling mode, which can be "on" or "off".
7. Configure any additional settings that you want, such as cooldown period, custom metadata, or notification channels.
8. Click the "Save" button to apply the changes.

#### Using the gcloud command-line tool:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have installed and configured the gcloud command-line tool.
2. Run the following command to update the autoscaling parameters for an instance group:
<pre><code>
gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-autoscaling INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --max-num-replicas MAX_REPLICAS \
    --min-num-replicas MIN_REPLICAS \
    --target-cpu-utilization TARGET_UTILIZATION \
    --cool-down-period COOLDOWN_PERIOD
</code></pre>
Replace INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the instance group that you want to configure, and replace MAX_REPLICAS, MIN_REPLICAS, TARGET_UTILIZATION, and COOLDOWN_PERIOD with the desired values for each parameter.

3. You can use other flags such as --custom-metadata, --mode, or --description to configure other settings as needed.
4. Run the following command to verify the autoscaling configuration:
<pre><code>
gcloud compute instance-groups managed describe INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME
</code></pre>
This will display the current autoscaling parameters for the instance group.

#### Using the Google Cloud API:
1. Use the instanceGroupManagers.patch method to update the autoscaling parameters for a managed instance group.
2. Set the autoscaler.minNumReplicas, autoscaler.maxNumReplicas, autoscaler.targetCpuUtilization, and autoscaler.coolDownPeriodSec fields to the desired values.
3. Include any other optional fields such as metadata.items or description to configure additional settings.
4. Send the API request to update the instance group. You can use the Google APIs client libraries, the Google Cloud SDK, or other HTTP client tools to make the API call.

Once you have set the autoscaling parameters for an instance group, the group will automatically scale up or down based on the current load and the target utilization level that you have configured. You can monitor the group's size and status using the Cloud Console, the gcloud command-line tool, or the Google Cloud API.


#### Assign instance templates
An instance template in Google Cloud Platform is a configuration file that defines the properties of a virtual machine (VM) instance, such as the machine type, boot disk image, metadata, and network settings. Instance templates are used to create multiple VM instances that have the same configuration, which makes it easier to manage groups of instances that serve the same purpose.

Instance templates can be used with managed instance groups in Google Cloud Platform to create a pool of identical instances that can be automatically scaled up or down based on traffic or other factors. By creating an instance template, you can define the configuration of each instance in the group, and then use the managed instance group to create and manage the instances based on that configuration.

When you create an instance template, you can specify various settings, such as the machine type, number of CPUs, amount of memory, disk size, boot disk image, startup script, and metadata. You can also configure network settings such as the VPC network, subnetwork, and IP address.

Instance templates are designed to be reusable and scalable, which means you can use them to create as many instances as needed without having to manually configure each one. You can also update an instance template to change the configuration of all instances that are based on it, which makes it easy to apply changes to a large number of instances at once.


To assign instance templates to instance groups in Google Cloud Platform, you can use the Cloud Console or the gcloud command-line tool. Here are the general steps:

#### Using the Cloud Console:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console in your web browser and navigate to the instance group that you want to assign an instance template to.
2. Click on the "Edit group" button to open the instance group details page.
3. In the "Instance template" section, select the instance template that you want to use for the group.
4. Click the "Save" button to apply the changes.

#### Using the gcloud command-line tool:
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and ensure that you have installed and configured the gcloud command-line tool.
2. Run the following command to update the instance template for an instance group:
<pre><code>
gcloud compute instance-groups managed set-instance-template INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME \
    --template INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME
</code></pre>
Replace INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME with the name of the instance group that you want to update, and replace INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME with the name of the instance template that you want to use.

3. You can include other optional flags such as --version or --description to configure additional settings.
4. Run the following command to verify the instance template configuration:

<pre><code>
gcloud compute instance-groups managed describe INSTANCE_GROUP_NAME
</code></pre>
This will display the current instance template for the instance group.

Once you have assigned an instance template to an instance group, any new instances that are created in the group will be based on that template. You can use the same instance template for multiple instance groups, or you can create different templates for different groups depending on their specific needs. You can also update the instance template at any time to make changes to the instance configuration or software packages that are installed on the instances.

#### Create an instance template

<pre><code>
gcloud compute instance-templates create INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME \
    --machine-type MACHINE_TYPE \
    --boot-disk-size BOOT_DISK_SIZE \
    --boot-disk-type BOOT_DISK_TYPE \
    --image IMAGE_NAME \
    --image-project IMAGE_PROJECT \
    --network NETWORK_NAME \
    --subnet SUBNETWORK_NAME \
    --tags NETWORK_TAGS \
    --metadata METADATA
</code></pre>
Replace INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME with the name you want to give the instance template, and replace the other values with the desired configuration settings. You can omit any optional flags that are not needed for your configuration.

3. Run the following command to verify the instance template configuration:
<pre><code>
gcloud compute instance-templates describe INSTANCE_TEMPLATE_NAME
</code></pre>
This will display the configuration of the new instance template.

Once you have created an instance template, you can use it to create a managed instance group or add instances to an existing group. When you create an instance group, you can select the instance template that you want to use and configure the desired scaling settings, such as the number of instances, autoscaling policies, and health checks.
