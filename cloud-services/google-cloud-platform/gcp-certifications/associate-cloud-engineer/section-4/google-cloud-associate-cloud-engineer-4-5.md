## Managing networking resources.

In Google Cloud Platform (GCP), network resources refer to a set of components that enable communication between various services and resources in the GCP infrastructure. Network resources are used to create virtual networks, define routing rules, and enforce security policies to protect data and systems.

Some of the main components of network resources in GCP include:

- Virtual Private Cloud (VPC): A virtual network that is isolated from other networks in GCP. Users can create and manage VPC networks and subnets, assign IP addresses, and configure routing and firewall rules.
- Load balancers: A service that distributes traffic across multiple backend servers to improve application availability and performance.
- Cloud Router: A service that dynamically exchanges routes between VPC networks and on-premises networks using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
- Cloud VPN: A service that provides a secure connection between GCP and an on-premises data center or other cloud platform using a virtual private network (VPN) tunnel.
- Cloud Interconnect: A service that provides a high-speed, low-latency connection between GCP and on-premises data centers or other cloud platforms through dedicated physical connections.
- DNS: A service that maps domain names to IP addresses, enabling users to access resources by their domain names.

Overall, network resources in GCP are designed to provide users with secure, reliable, and highly available network connectivity for their applications and services.

### Adding a subnet to an existing VPC
To add a subnet to an existing VPC in Google Cloud Platform, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the VPC network that contains the VPC to which you want to add a subnet.
2. Click on the "Subnets" tab.
3. Click the "Create subnet" button.
4. Enter a name for the new subnet, and choose the region and IP address range for the subnet.
5. Configure the subnet's secondary IP ranges, if needed.
6. If you want to enable Private Google Access, select the checkbox for "Private Google access".
7. If you want to use an existing subnet for DHCP options, select the checkbox for "Use custom DHCP options".
8. Click the "Create" button to create the new subnet.

After you've added the subnet, you can use it to launch new instances or deploy services within the VPC.


### Expanding a subnet to have more IP addresses
To expand a subnet in Google Cloud Platform, follow these steps:

1. Open the VPC network page in the Cloud Console.
2. Select the VPC network that contains the subnet you want to expand.
3. Click on the subnet that you want to modify.
4. On the Subnet details page, click Edit at the top of the page.
5. In the IP allocation section, change the IPv4 CIDR range to a larger range that includes the additional IP addresses that you need.
6. If the subnet has existing resources, you need to recreate the resources that depend on the subnet. Click Done to save the changes and expand the subnet.

It is important to note that expanding a subnet will impact the routing of the VPC network. You should verify that the new subnet range does not overlap with existing subnets or other IP address ranges in your VPC network before expanding it.

### Reserving static external or internal IP addresses
You can reserve static external or internal IP addresses in Google Cloud Platform by following these steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the VPC network where you want to reserve the static IP address.
2. Click on "External IP addresses" or "Internal IP addresses" depending on the type of IP address you want to reserve.
3. Click "Reserve Static Address" at the top of the page.
4. In the "Create a static external/internal IP address" page, select the region where you want to use the IP address.
5. Enter a name for the IP address, and any optional description.
6. Choose the IP address version you want to reserve (IPv4 or IPv6).
7. If you are reserving an external IP address, choose the purpose of the IP address from the dropdown list.
8. Click the "Reserve" button.

After you have reserved a static IP address, you can assign it to a resource, such as a VM instance, by selecting it in the configuration settings for that resource.

### Working with CloudDNS, CloudNAT, Load Balancers and firewall rules

#### CloudDNS
Google Cloud DNS is a scalable, reliable and managed authoritative Domain Name System (DNS) service that provides a simple way to publish and resolve custom DNS zones using the same infrastructure that Google uses internally. It provides reliable, low-latency, and cost-effective DNS serving for DNS zones hosted on Google Cloud, which can be managed using the Google Cloud Console, the gcloud command-line tool, or the Cloud DNS API. Cloud DNS can be used to manage DNS zones and records for both public and private IP addresses.

#### CloudDNS Best Practices
Here are some best practices for Cloud DNS in Google Cloud Platform:

1. Use a separate managed zone for each domain: You should create a separate managed zone for each domain that you own or manage. This makes it easier to manage your DNS records and makes it less likely that you'll accidentally delete or modify records for other domains.
2. Use relative domain names: When creating DNS records, it's best to use relative domain names instead of absolute domain names. This makes it easier to move your DNS records to a different domain later on.
3. Use CNAME records instead of A records: Whenever possible, use CNAME records instead of A records. This allows you to easily change the IP address of your domain's resources in the future.
4. Limit the number of DNS queries: Each DNS query adds a small amount of latency to your application. To reduce the number of DNS queries, you can use DNS caching, reduce the TTL of your DNS records, and use DNS load balancing.
5. Enable DNSSEC: DNSSEC provides an additional layer of security for your DNS records. Enabling DNSSEC ensures that your DNS records are not modified or replaced by unauthorized parties.
6. Use DNS monitoring and logging: Monitoring and logging your DNS traffic can help you identify and troubleshoot DNS issues, such as misconfigured DNS records or DNS attacks.
7. Keep your DNS records up to date: As your application changes over time, it's important to keep your DNS records up to date. This includes removing DNS records for resources that no longer exist, and updating DNS records for resources that have moved to a different IP address or domain.

#### CloudNAT
CloudNAT is a network address translation (NAT) service provided by Google Cloud Platform. It enables instances in private subnets to access the internet and receive responses from the internet while hiding their private IP addresses. This service is designed to help you control egress traffic, increase security, and reduce the number of public IP addresses required for your Google Cloud Platform resources. CloudNAT also supports IP masquerading, which allows instances to appear as if they are the IP address of their NAT gateway when communicating with external systems.

#### CloudNAT Best Practices
Here are some best practices for CloudNAT on Google Cloud Platform:

1. Use it only when necessary: CloudNAT should only be used when there is a real need for a private IP range to access the internet, and not as a default option for all traffic.
2. Choose the right size: Choose the appropriate size for your CloudNAT gateway, based on your expected traffic volume and the number of instances that will use the NAT gateway.
3. Use multiple CloudNAT gateways: For increased reliability and redundancy, it is recommended to use multiple CloudNAT gateways across different regions.
4. Monitor and optimize: Monitor the usage of your CloudNAT gateway, including the number of connections, bytes sent and received, and the number of active instances. You can also optimize the use of CloudNAT by batching requests and enabling IP masquerading.
5. Use Cloud Router: For better routing between your VPC network and your on-premises network, use Cloud Router with CloudNAT.
6. Enable logging and alerts: Enable logging and alerts for CloudNAT activity, and set up alerts for any unusual activity, such as high traffic volumes or excessive usage of resources. This will help you detect and address any issues quickly.
7. Secure your network: Ensure that your network is secure by using firewall rules to control access to your instances and resources, and by using HTTPS or SSL/TLS to encrypt your traffic.

Cloud Router is a networking service on Google Cloud Platform that enables you to dynamically exchange routes among your Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) networks and your on-premises networks by using Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). It provides a highly available, scalable, and flexible way to route traffic between your networks. Cloud Router can be used to create a global dynamic routing service for your hybrid network that is highly available, and it supports routing of IPv4 and IPv6 traffic.

#### LoadBalancers
Here are some best practices for load balancers in Google Cloud Platform:

1. Use a globally distributed load balancer for high availability and to ensure your services are reachable from anywhere in the world.
2. Configure health checks to ensure that the load balancer routes traffic only to healthy backend instances.
3. Use HTTPS load balancing to secure user connections over the internet, and use SSL policies to customize the SSL/TLS versions and ciphers.
4. Use HTTP/2 for HTTP(S) load balancing to take advantage of its multiplexing, header compression, and other features that can improve the performance of your applications.
5. Use regional load balancing when you need to balance traffic within a region or across multiple regions, but don't require global load balancing.
6. Configure autoscaling to add or remove instances in response to changes in traffic.
7. Use Cloud CDN to improve the performance of your web applications by serving static content, such as images and videos, from a cache located near the user.
8. Use Cloud Armor to protect your applications from DDoS attacks, by configuring security policies that allow only legitimate traffic to reach your load balancer.
9. Monitor your load balancer to ensure that it's working correctly and to troubleshoot any issues that arise.
10. Finally, make sure to review and understand the pricing for load balancing and adjust your usage accordingly to optimize costs.

#### Firewall Rules
Here are some best practices for firewall rules in Google Cloud Platform:

1. Follow the principle of least privilege: Create the minimum set of firewall rules required to achieve your business goals.
2. Use service accounts instead of IP addresses: Service accounts are a better way to control access to Google Cloud resources because they offer a better balance of flexibility and security.
3. Use Network Tags: Assigning network tags to resources is a good way to simplify firewall rules. You can create a rule that applies to all resources with a specific network tag instead of creating individual rules for each resource.
4. Regularly review and update firewall rules: It's important to regularly review and update firewall rules to ensure they still apply to the current business requirements.
5. Use logging and monitoring: Firewall rules should be monitored for potential security risks. Use logging and monitoring tools to identify and respond to security threats.
6. Use VPC Service Controls: VPC Service Controls provide an additional layer of security by allowing you to define a security perimeter around Google Cloud resources. This helps to mitigate the risk of data exfiltration and ensures that sensitive data is only accessed from authorized networks.
7. Use HTTPS: Use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. Google Cloud Load Balancers support HTTPS as a termination protocol.
