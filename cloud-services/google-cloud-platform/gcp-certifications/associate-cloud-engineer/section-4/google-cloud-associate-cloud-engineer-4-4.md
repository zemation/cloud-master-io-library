##  Managing storage and database solutions

### Managing and securing objects in and between Cloud Storage buckets
In Google Cloud Storage, objects are the basic unit of storage that contain the data you want to store. Each object consists of the actual data and metadata that describes the data.

The data is simply a sequence of bytes, which can be anything from a single line of text to a large video file. The metadata includes information such as the object name, size, creation time, and content type.

Objects are stored in buckets, which are containers for your data. You can think of a bucket as a top-level folder that contains your objects. You can create as many buckets as you need and store as many objects as you want in each bucket.

One of the key features of Google Cloud Storage is its scalability. You can store as many objects as you need, and Google automatically distributes them across multiple servers and data centers for durability and availability. This means that your data is always safe, even if one or more servers fail.

Additionally, you can control access to your objects by setting permissions and using signed URLs, which allows you to share access to specific objects with others without giving them full access to your bucket.

There are several ways to secure objects in and between Google Cloud Storage buckets. Here are some of the ways:

Access Control: You can set up Access Control Lists (ACLs) or Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies for each bucket or object to control who has access to them.

Object Versioning: Object Versioning is a feature that allows you to keep multiple versions of an object in a bucket. It provides protection against accidental or malicious deletion of objects and also allows you to retrieve previous versions of the objects.

Encryption: Google Cloud Storage provides automatic server-side encryption for all objects uploaded to a bucket. You can also use your own encryption keys to protect your objects with customer-supplied encryption keys (CSEK).

Signed URLs and Signed Policy Documents: You can create a signed URL that provides temporary access to an object. You can also create a signed policy document that defines a set of conditions that an HTTP request must meet to access an object.

Object Lifecycle Management: You can use Object Lifecycle Management to automatically delete or transition objects to a different storage class based on rules that you define.

These are just a few examples of the many ways you can secure objects in and between Google Cloud Storage buckets.

### Setting object life cycle management policies for Cloud Storage buckets

Object lifecycle management is a feature in Google Cloud Storage that allows you to define rules for automatically archiving or deleting objects based on their age or when they meet certain criteria. By defining lifecycle policies, you can effectively manage the lifecycle of your data and optimize the cost of storing and managing it.

Here are some common lifecycle management policies in Google Cloud Storage:

1. Delete objects after a certain amount of time: You can configure lifecycle policies to automatically delete objects in a bucket after a specific number of days or a certain date.
2. Move objects to a cheaper storage class: You can use lifecycle policies to move objects to a cheaper storage class, such as Standard Nearline Storage or Coldline Storage, after a certain period of time.
3. Delete versions of objects: You can use lifecycle policies to delete older versions of objects in a bucket. This can help you reduce the cost of storing multiple versions of the same object.
4. Apply lifecycle policies to specific objects or object prefixes: You can apply lifecycle policies to specific objects or object prefixes within a bucket, rather than the entire bucket.

To create a lifecycle management policy for a bucket in Google Cloud Storage, you can use the GCP Console, the gsutil command-line tool, or the JSON API.

Here is an example of a lifecycle policy in Google Cloud Storage:

Suppose you have a bucket named "example-bucket" in which you store daily logs, and you want to delete any object that is older than 30 days to save on storage costs. You can create a lifecycle policy to automate the process of deleting these objects. Here are the steps to create the lifecycle policy:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to your "example-bucket" in the Storage Browser.
2. Click the "Edit Bucket Lifecycle" button in the toolbar.
3. In the "Add a rule" section, choose "Delete" from the action dropdown.
4. In the "Age" field, enter "30" to indicate that any object older than 30 days should be deleted.
5. In the "Conditions" section, you can further customize the policy by adding additional conditions that must be met for the rule to apply. For example, you can specify that the rule should only apply to objects with a certain prefix, or objects in a specific storage class.
6. Click "Save" to apply the policy to your bucket.

Once you've created the policy, Google Cloud Storage will automatically apply the rule and delete any objects in the bucket that are older than 30 days. This helps you to save on storage costs by removing data that is no longer needed.

### Executing queries to retrieve data from data instances (e.g., Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Cloud Spanner, Datastore, Cloud Bigtable)

#### Cloud SQL
Here's an example of executing a query to retrieve data from a Cloud SQL instance using MySQL:

1. First, connect to the Cloud SQL instance using the command-line tool of your choice. For example, to connect using the MySQL command-line tool, you would use the following command:

<pre><code>
mysql --host=[INSTANCE_IP] --user=[USERNAME] --password
</code></pre>
Replace [INSTANCE_IP] with the IP address of your Cloud SQL instance, and [USERNAME] with the username you want to use to connect.

2. Once you're connected to the Cloud SQL instance, you can execute queries to retrieve data from the database. For example, to retrieve all rows from a table named customers, you would use the following command:

<pre><code>
SELECT * FROM customers;
</code></pre>
This would return all columns and rows from the customers table. 

3. You can also filter the results using a WHERE clause. For example, to retrieve only the rows where the city column is set to New York, you would use the following command:

<pre><code>
SELECT * FROM customers WHERE city = 'New York';
</code></pre>

4. You can also use other SQL functions and commands to manipulate the data. For example, to retrieve the total number of rows in the customers table, you would use the following command:

<pre><code>
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customers;
</code></pre>

These are just a few examples of how to execute queries to retrieve data from a Cloud SQL instance. The exact commands you would use depend on the database management system you're using (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.) and the specific queries you want to execute.

#### BigQuery
Here's an example of executing a query to retrieve data from a BigQuery table using the BigQuery web UI:

1. Open the BigQuery web UI in the Google Cloud Console.
2. Select the project that contains the dataset and table you want to query.
3. In the left-hand navigation pane, select the dataset that contains the table you want to query.
4. Find the table you want to query and click on it to open its details.
5. On the right-hand side of the details page, click on the "Preview" tab.
6. In the query editor at the top of the page, enter a SQL query to retrieve the data you want. For example, the following query retrieves all rows from a table called "my_table":

<pre><code>
SELECT * FROM `my_dataset.my_table`
</code></pre>
7. Click on the "Run" button to execute the query.
8. After the query has completed, the results will be displayed in a table below the query editor.

You can also execute queries using the bq command-line tool or the BigQuery API. The process will be similar to the web UI, but you will need to use the appropriate syntax for the tool or API you are using.

#### Cloud Spanner
Here's an example of executing a query to retrieve data from a table in Cloud Spanner:

Suppose you have a table named users in a Cloud Spanner database with columns id, name, email, and created_at. To retrieve all the rows from this table, you can use the following query:

<pre><code>
SELECT id, name, email, created_at FROM users
</code></pre>
To execute this query in Cloud Spanner, you can use the Cloud Spanner client library for your preferred programming language. Here's an example in Python:

<pre><code>
from google.cloud import spanner

# Instantiates a client
spanner_client = spanner.Client()

# Your Cloud Spanner instance ID.
instance_id = 'your-instance-id'

# Your Cloud Spanner database ID.
database_id = 'your-database-id'

# Gets a reference to a Cloud Spanner database.
database = spanner_client.instance(instance_id).database(database_id)

# SQL query to retrieve all the rows from the `users` table.
query = """
    SELECT id, name, email, created_at
    FROM users
"""

# Executes the query and prints the results.
with database.snapshot() as snapshot:
    results = snapshot.execute_sql(query)
    for row in results:
        print(row)
</code></pre>
This will execute the query and print the results to the console. You can modify the query to retrieve specific rows or apply filters based on your requirements.

#### Datastore
Cloud Datastore has been deprecated by Google and replaced by Firestore in Datastore mode. Firestore in Datastore mode provides backward compatibility for Datastore APIs, client libraries, and client SDKs, and it supports most of the features of Datastore, including queries, indexes, and transactions.

Here's an example of executing a query to retrieve data from a collection in Firestore in Datastore mode using the Node.js client library:

<pre><code>
const {Firestore} = require('@google-cloud/firestore');

// Create a new Firestore client
const firestore = new Firestore();

// Define the collection to query
const collectionRef = firestore.collection('my-collection');

// Execute the query
collectionRef.where('age', '>', 30)
             .get()
             .then((querySnapshot) => {
               querySnapshot.forEach((doc) => {
                 console.log(doc.id, ' => ', doc.data());
               });
             })
             .catch((error) => {
               console.log('Error getting documents: ', error);
             });
</code></pre>
This example queries the my-collection collection for documents where the age field is greater than 30, and then logs the id and data of each document returned by the query.

#### Cloud Bigtable
Cloud Bigtable is a NoSQL, wide-column database service for storing and querying massive datasets. The structure of Bigtable tables is different from a traditional SQL table.

Here's an example of how to retrieve data from a table in Bigtable using the HBase shell:

1. Start the HBase shell by running the following command:

<pre><code>
hbase shell
</code></pre>

2. Connect to your Cloud Bigtable instance by running the following command, where [PROJECT-ID] is your Google Cloud project ID, [INSTANCE-ID] is your Cloud Bigtable instance ID, and [TABLE-NAME] is the name of the table you want to query:

<pre><code>
./cbt -project=[PROJECT-ID] -instance=[INSTANCE-ID] read [TABLE-NAME]
</code></pre>

3. Use the scan command to retrieve data from the table. For example, to retrieve all rows and columns, you can run the following command:
<pre><code>
scan
</code></pre>

4. You can also specify a row key or a range of row keys to retrieve specific rows. For example, to retrieve the row with key row1, you can run the following command:

<pre><code>
get 'row1'
</code></pre>
To retrieve a range of rows, you can run the following command, where [START-ROW] and [END-ROW] are the start and end row keys of the range:

<pre><code>
scan '[START-ROW]', '[END-ROW]'
</code></pre>

5. You can filter the results by column families or columns. For example, to retrieve all columns in the cf1 column family, you can run the following command:

<pre><code>
scan 'cf1'
</code></pre>
To retrieve only the col1 column in the cf1 column family, you can run the following command:

<pre><code>
scan 'cf1', {COLUMN => 'cf1:col1'}
</code></pre>
You can also combine filters to retrieve only the rows and columns you need.

6. Once you're finished, you can exit the HBase shell by running the following command:
<pre><code>
exit
</code></pre>

### Explain how to estimate the costs of data storage resources in Google Cloud Platform
In Google Cloud Platform, you can estimate the costs of data storage resources using the GCP Pricing Calculator. Here's how:

1. Go to the GCP Pricing Calculator website (https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator).
2. Select the products you are interested in by searching for them in the search bar.
3. Set the usage values for the selected products based on your expected usage.
4. Click the "Add to Estimate" button to add the product to your estimate.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 for all the products you want to include in your estimate.
6. Once you've added all the products you're interested in, review the estimate to ensure that it reflects your expected usage and requirements.
7. Click the "Download PDF" button to save a PDF copy of the estimate for future reference.

Note that the estimate is only an approximation of the actual costs, and the actual costs may vary depending on various factors such as usage, location, and other factors. It's important to review and update your estimate regularly to ensure it accurately reflects your current usage and requirements.

### Backing up and restoring database instances (e.g., Cloud SQL, Datastore)
#### Cloud SQL
You can backup and restore database instances in Cloud SQL on Google Cloud Platform using the following steps:

1. Create a backup: You can create a backup by selecting your Cloud SQL instance from the Cloud SQL instances page in the Google Cloud Console. Then click on "Backup" in the top menu bar and select "Create Backup". Provide a name for the backup and click "Create Backup".
2. Restore a backup: To restore a backup, go to the Cloud SQL instances page, select the instance you want to restore, and click on "Backups" in the top menu bar. Select the backup you want to restore, click on "Restore" and follow the prompts.
3. Manage backups: You can manage your backups from the Backups page for each Cloud SQL instance in the Google Cloud Console. Here, you can view the list of backups, delete backups, and create new ones.

It is important to note that backups in Cloud SQL are incremental and automatic, so you don't need to manually create backups on a regular basis. You can also configure automated backups for your instances, and specify the retention period for backups to be stored.

#### Datastore
In Google Cloud Platform, Datastore provides two ways of backing up and restoring database instances: managed backups and manual backups.

Managed backups are performed automatically by Google Cloud Datastore, and they provide an easy way to recover data in case of accidental data loss or corruption. Managed backups are stored in Google Cloud Storage and are available for up to 30 days. You can restore a managed backup by creating a new Datastore instance and selecting the backup you want to restore from.

To enable managed backups, you need to create a Cloud Storage bucket and link it to your Datastore instance. Managed backups can be scheduled to run daily, weekly, or monthly, and you can specify a retention policy to keep backups for a specific amount of time.

Manual backups are performed by exporting the data from a Datastore instance to a file stored in Google Cloud Storage. Manual backups can be used to archive data, move data between environments, or restore a Datastore instance to a previous state. You can create a manual backup using the Cloud Console, the gcloud command-line tool, or the Datastore API.

To restore a manual backup, you need to create a new Datastore instance and import the backup data from the Cloud Storage file. You can also use manual backups to migrate data to another database, like Cloud SQL or BigQuery, by exporting the data from Datastore and importing it into the new database.

### Reviewing job status in Dataproc, Dataflow, or BigQuery
#### Dataproc
In Dataproc, you can review job status in several ways:

1. Cloud Console: Open the Cloud Console, select your Dataproc cluster, and go to the Jobs tab. Here, you can view job status, logs, and other details. You can also submit new jobs from this page.
2. Command-line interface (CLI): Use the gcloud dataproc jobs list command to view a list of jobs running on a Dataproc cluster. You can use this command to retrieve job IDs and statuses, as well as filter jobs by status or submitter.
3. REST API: Use the Dataproc API to retrieve job status and other details programmatically. You can use the REST API to retrieve job status, list jobs, and retrieve job logs.
4. Monitoring: Dataproc integrates with Stackdriver, which allows you to view cluster and job metrics, monitor logs, and receive alerts for job failures and other issues.

Overall, the best approach for reviewing job status in Dataproc depends on your specific use case and preferences.

#### Dataflow
To review job status in Dataflow on Google Cloud Platform, you can follow these steps:

1. Go to the Google Cloud Console and select your project.
2. In the left navigation panel, select "Dataflow" under the "Big Data" section.
3. You will see a list of your Dataflow jobs, including their status, job ID, creation time, and start time.
4. To view the logs for a job, click on the job ID. This will take you to the job details page.
5. On the job details page, you can view logs and metrics for the job, including the job graph, input/output data, and job status. You can also view any errors or warnings that occurred during the job execution.
6. You can also use the Cloud Monitoring tool to monitor job metrics, create custom alerts, and set up notifications for job status changes.

By following these steps, you can monitor and review the status of your Dataflow jobs on Google Cloud Platform.

#### BigQuery
You can review job status in BigQuery on Google Cloud Platform by using the web UI, the command-line tool bq, or the API.

Here's how to check job status using the web UI:

1. Go to the BigQuery web UI in your Google Cloud Console.
2. On the left navigation panel, click on the "Job history" section.
3. You will see a list of completed and running jobs.
4. Click on a running job to see its details, or click on a completed job to see its results.

Here's how to check job status using the bq command-line tool:

1. Open your terminal and ensure that you have the bq tool installed and configured with your Google Cloud account.
2. Use the following command to list all the jobs that have been executed in the last 24 hours:

<pre><code>
bq ls -j -a --max_results=1000 --min_creation_time=$(date -d '-24 hours' +%s) | grep -i '{job_id}\|state\|error_result'
</code></pre>
This command lists the job ID, state, and error (if any) for each job.

3. If you want to see the details of a specific job, use the following command:

<pre><code>
bq show -j {job_id}
</code></pre>
Replace {job_id} with the actual job ID.

Here's how to check job status using the API:

1. Use the jobs.get method in the BigQuery API to get the status of a specific job.
2. You will need to provide the project ID, job ID, and the location of the job.
3. The API will return a JSON response with the status and other details of the job.
