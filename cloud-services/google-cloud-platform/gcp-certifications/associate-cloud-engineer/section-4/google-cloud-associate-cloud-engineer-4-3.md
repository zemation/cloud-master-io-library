##  Managing Cloud Run resources

### Cloud Run
Google Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform offered by Google Cloud that enables you to run stateless HTTP-driven containers on a fully-managed environment. It allows developers to deploy their applications in a containerized environment without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Cloud Run provides automatic scaling, built-in network load balancing, and integrates with other Google Cloud services such as Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring. It supports several programming languages and allows developers to run their own container images or use pre-built images from the Cloud Run Container Registry.



### Adjusting application traffic-splitting parameters
Google Cloud Run allows you to deploy serverless applications in a containerized form on a fully-managed environment. It automatically scales the number of container instances to handle incoming requests, and you only pay for the resources you use.

You can adjust the traffic-splitting parameters in Google Cloud Run using the following steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and go to the Cloud Run page.
2. Select the service whose traffic-splitting parameters you want to adjust.
3. Click on the 'Edit & deploy new revision' button.
4. In the 'Traffic' section, you can adjust the traffic percentages to each revision.
5. You can also add or remove revisions and adjust the traffic distribution accordingly.
6. Click on 'Deploy' to save the changes.

Alternatively, you can also use the gcloud command-line tool to update the traffic-splitting parameters. Here's an example command:

<pre><code>
gcloud run services update SERVICE-NAME --update-traffic=TAG=TRAFFIC-ALLOCATION
</code></pre>

In this command, replace SERVICE-NAME with the name of your service, TAG with the tag of the revision that you want to update, and TRAFFIC-ALLOCATION with the percentage of traffic that you want to allocate to the revision.

These are some ways in which you can adjust the traffic-splitting parameters in Google Cloud Run.

### Setting scaling parameters for autoscaling instances
You can set scaling parameters for autoscaling instances with Google Cloud Run using the following steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Run service page.
2. Click on the service for which you want to configure autoscaling.
3. Click the "Edit & Deploy New Revision" button.
4. Under the "Service Settings" section, locate the "Scaling" options.
5. Choose the "Autoscaling" option.
6. Set the minimum and maximum number of instances for the service.
7. Choose the metric by which you want to scale the service (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage).
8. Set the target value for the chosen metric.
9. Choose the maximum number of concurrent requests per instance.
10. Click the "Save" button to save your changes.

Once you have configured autoscaling, Cloud Run will automatically scale the number of instances based on the defined criteria.

#### Run fully managed Cloud Run or Cloud Run for Anthos
Anthos is a hybrid and multi-cloud platform offered by Google Cloud Platform. It enables customers to deploy, manage, and scale applications across both on-premises and multiple clouds, including public cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. Anthos provides a consistent and secure experience across all environments, simplifying the management of complex applications and enabling a consistent and uniform policy enforcement. It leverages open source technologies like Kubernetes and Istio, along with Google Cloud services like Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, and Cloud SQL.

Google Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform for running containerized applications, which automatically scales the number of instances up and down based on the incoming traffic. On the other hand, Cloud Run for Anthos provides a container platform that can run on-premises or on a cloud, bringing the benefits of Cloud Run to Kubernetes clusters.

You should consider using Cloud Run for Anthos when you have an existing Kubernetes cluster on-premises or on a cloud, and you want to use a consistent platform across different environments. This allows you to run containerized applications with the same API and developer experience as Cloud Run, but on a Kubernetes environment.

In contrast, you should consider using fully managed Cloud Run when you want to focus on building and deploying applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Fully managed Cloud Run takes care of scaling, updating, and securing the application, and charges based on the number of requests and the duration of the function.
