##  Managing Cloud Run resources

### Cloud Run
Google Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform offered by Google Cloud that enables you to run stateless HTTP-driven containers on a fully-managed environment. It allows developers to deploy their applications in a containerized environment without worrying about the underlying infrastructure. Cloud Run provides automatic scaling, built-in network load balancing, and integrates with other Google Cloud services such as Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring. It supports several programming languages and allows developers to run their own container images or use pre-built images from the Cloud Run Container Registry.



### Adjusting application traffic-splitting parameters
Google Cloud Run allows you to deploy serverless applications in a containerized form on a fully-managed environment. It automatically scales the number of container instances to handle incoming requests, and you only pay for the resources you use.

You can adjust the traffic-splitting parameters in Google Cloud Run using the following steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and go to the Cloud Run page.
2. Select the service whose traffic-splitting parameters you want to adjust.
3. Click on the 'Edit & deploy new revision' button.
4. In the 'Traffic' section, you can adjust the traffic percentages to each revision.
5. You can also add or remove revisions and adjust the traffic distribution accordingly.
6. Click on 'Deploy' to save the changes.

Alternatively, you can also use the gcloud command-line tool to update the traffic-splitting parameters. Here's an example command:

<pre><code>
gcloud run services update SERVICE-NAME --update-traffic=TAG=TRAFFIC-ALLOCATION
</code></pre>

In this command, replace SERVICE-NAME with the name of your service, TAG with the tag of the revision that you want to update, and TRAFFIC-ALLOCATION with the percentage of traffic that you want to allocate to the revision.

These are some ways in which you can adjust the traffic-splitting parameters in Google Cloud Run.

### Setting scaling parameters for autoscaling instances
You can set scaling parameters for autoscaling instances with Google Cloud Run using the following steps:

1. Open the Google Cloud Console and navigate to the Cloud Run service page.
2. Click on the service for which you want to configure autoscaling.
3. Click the "Edit & Deploy New Revision" button.
4. Under the "Service Settings" section, locate the "Scaling" options.
5. Choose the "Autoscaling" option.
6. Set the minimum and maximum number of instances for the service.
7. Choose the metric by which you want to scale the service (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage).
8. Set the target value for the chosen metric.
9. Choose the maximum number of concurrent requests per instance.
10. Click the "Save" button to save your changes.

Once you have configured autoscaling, Cloud Run will automatically scale the number of instances based on the defined criteria.

#### Run fully managed Cloud Run or Cloud Run for Anthos
Anthos is a hybrid and multi-cloud platform offered by Google Cloud Platform. It enables customers to deploy, manage, and scale applications across both on-premises and multiple clouds, including public cloud platforms such as AWS and Azure. Anthos provides a consistent and secure experience across all environments, simplifying the management of complex applications and enabling a consistent and uniform policy enforcement. It leverages open source technologies like Kubernetes and Istio, along with Google Cloud services like Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, and Cloud SQL.

Google Cloud Run is a fully managed serverless platform for running containerized applications, which automatically scales the number of instances up and down based on the incoming traffic. On the other hand, Cloud Run for Anthos provides a container platform that can run on-premises or on a cloud, bringing the benefits of Cloud Run to Kubernetes clusters.

You should consider using Cloud Run for Anthos when you have an existing Kubernetes cluster on-premises or on a cloud, and you want to use a consistent platform across different environments. This allows you to run containerized applications with the same API and developer experience as Cloud Run, but on a Kubernetes environment.

In contrast, you should consider using fully managed Cloud Run when you want to focus on building and deploying applications without managing the underlying infrastructure. Fully managed Cloud Run takes care of scaling, updating, and securing the application, and charges based on the number of requests and the duration of the function.

Here are some best practices for using Cloud Run on Google Cloud Platform:
- Optimize container image size: Cloud Run scales containers based on the number of requests received. Optimizing the size of the container image can help reduce startup time and improve overall performance.
- Use environment variables: Store configuration settings in environment variables instead of hardcoding values in the container image. This makes it easier to manage and update configurations without rebuilding the container image.
- Set resource limits: Set resource limits for your services to prevent them from consuming too much CPU or memory. This can help prevent performance issues and ensure that other services on the same host are not impacted.
- Use service accounts: Use service accounts to grant permissions to your Cloud Run services instead of using user accounts. This improves security and reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- Enable logging and monitoring: Enable logging and monitoring to capture metrics and diagnose issues. You can use Cloud Logging and Cloud Monitoring to monitor and diagnose your Cloud Run services.
- Implement proper authentication and authorization: Implement proper authentication and authorization for your Cloud Run services. Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) to control who has access to your services and what actions they can perform.
- Use HTTPS: Use HTTPS to secure communication between clients and your Cloud Run services. You can use Google-managed SSL certificates or bring your own certificates.
- Configure autoscaling: Configure autoscaling to ensure that your services can handle fluctuations in traffic. You can set autoscaling policies based on CPU utilization, memory usage, or requests per second.
- Implement caching: Implement caching to improve the performance of your Cloud Run services. You can use Cloud Memorystore for Redis to store and retrieve cached data.
- Test and deploy with automation: Use automation to test and deploy your Cloud Run services. This can help ensure that your services are reliable and performant, and that changes are deployed safely and quickly.

Cloud Run for Anthos is a managed service that allows you to run containerized applications on Anthos clusters. Here are some best practices for using Cloud Run for Anthos in Google Cloud Platform:
- Use namespaces: Namespaces allow you to isolate resources within a cluster. Use namespaces to organize your workloads and manage access control.
- Use service accounts: Cloud Run for Anthos uses service accounts to authorize access to other Google Cloud services. Use a separate service account for each workload to ensure least privilege.
- Use pod anti-affinity: Pod anti-affinity ensures that pods are scheduled onto different nodes in the cluster, which improves availability.
- Use horizontal pod autoscaling (HPA): HPA automatically scales your pods up or down based on demand. Use HPA to ensure that your workloads are responsive to traffic spikes.
- Use Istio: Istio is an open-source service mesh that provides traffic management, security, and observability features. Use Istio to manage traffic between services and secure communications.
- Use Stackdriver Logging and Monitoring: Stackdriver Logging and Monitoring allow you to view logs and metrics for your applications running on Cloud Run for Anthos. Use Stackdriver to troubleshoot issues and gain insights into your applications.
- Use Config Connector: Config Connector allows you to manage Google Cloud resources as Kubernetes objects. Use Config Connector to manage your Cloud Run for Anthos resources alongside your Kubernetes resources.
- Use GitOps: GitOps is a development methodology that uses Git as a source of truth for configuration and deployment. Use GitOps to manage your Cloud Run for Anthos resources and ensure that your infrastructure is version controlled.
- Use security best practices: Follow security best practices, such as using secure container images, enabling network security policies, and enabling automatic security updates, to ensure that your workloads are secure.
- Use versioned APIs: Versioned APIs ensure that your workloads are not affected by breaking changes in the API. Use versioned APIs to ensure compatibility and maintainability.
