## Exam guide

### Section 1: Applying site reliability engineering principles to a service

#### 1.1 Balance change, velocity, and reliability of the service:

- Discover SLIs (e.g., availability, latency)
-  Define SLOs and understand SLAs
-  Agree to consequences of not meeting the error budget
-  Construct feedback loops to decide what to build next
-  Eliminate toil via automation

#### 1.2 Manage service life cycle:

- Manage a service (e.g., introduce a new service, deploy, maintain, and retire it)
- Plan for capacity (e.g., quotas and limits management)

#### 1.3 Ensure healthy communication and collaboration for operations:
- Prevent burnout (e.g., set up automation processes to prevent burnout)
- Foster a learning culture
- Foster a culture of blamelessness

### Section 2: Building and implementing CI/CD pipelines for a service

#### 2.1 Design CI/CD pipelines:
- Creating and storing immutable artifacts with Artifact Registry
- Deployment strategies with Cloud Build and Spinnaker
- Deployment to hybrid and multicloud environments with Anthos, Spinnaker, and Kubernetes
- Artifact versioning strategy with Cloud Build and Artifact Registry
- CI/CD pipeline triggers with Cloud Source Repositories, external SCM, and Pub/Sub
- Testing a new version with Spinnaker
- Configuring deployment processes (e.g., approval flows)

#### 2.2 Implement CI/CD pipelines:
- CI with Cloud Build
- CD with Cloud Build
- Open source tooling (e.g., Jenkins, Spinnaker, GitLab, Concourse)
- Auditing and tracing of deployments (e.g., CSR, Artifact Registry, Cloud Build, Cloud Audit Logs)

#### 2.3 Manage configuration and secrets:
- Secure storage methods
- Secret rotation and config changes

#### 2.4 Manage infrastructure as code:
- Terraform
- Infrastructure code versioning
- Make infrastructure changes safer
- Immutable architecture

#### 2.5 Deploy CI/CD tooling:
- Centralized tools vs. multiple tools (single vs. multi-tenant)
- Security of CI/CD tooling

#### 2.6 Manage different development environments (e.g., staging, production):
- Decide on the number of environments and their purpose
- Create environments dynamically per feature branch with GKE
- Local development environments with Docker, Cloud Code, Skaffold

#### 2.7 Secure the deployment pipeline:
- Vulnerability analysis with Artifact Registry
- Binary Authorization
- IAM policies per environment

## Section 3: Implementing service monitoring strategies

#### 3.1 Manage application logs:
- Collecting logs from Compute Engine, GKE with Cloud Logging, Fluentd
- Collecting third-party and structured logs with Cloud Logging, Fluentd
- Sending application logs directly to the Cloud Logging API

#### 3.2 Manage application metrics with Cloud Monitoring:
- Collecting metrics from Compute Engine
- Collecting GKE/Kubernetes metrics
- Use Metrics Explorer for ad hoc metric analysis

#### 3.3 Manage Cloud Monitoring platform:
- Creating a monitoring dashboard
- Filtering and sharing dashboards
- Configure third-party alerting in Cloud Monitoring (e.g., PagerDuty, Slack)
- Define alerting policies based on SLIs with Cloud Monitoring
- Automate alerting policy definition with Terraform
- Implementing SLO monitoring and alerting with Cloud Monitoring
- Understand Cloud Monitoring integrations (e.g., Grafana, BigQuery)
- Using SIEM tools to analyze audit/flow logs (e.g., Splunk, Datadog)
- Design Cloud Monitoring metrics scopes

#### 3.4 Manage Cloud Logging platform:
- Enabling data access logs (e.g., Cloud Audit Logs)
- Enabling VPC flow logs
- Viewing logs in the Google Cloud Console
- Using basic vs. advanced logging filters
- Implementing logs-based metrics
- Understanding the logging exclusion vs. logging export
- Selecting the options for logging export
- Implementing a project-level / org-level export
- Viewing export logs in Cloud Storage and BigQuery
- Sending logs to an external logging platform

#### 3.5 Implement logging and monitoring access controls:
- Set ACL to restrict access to audit logs with IAM, Cloud Logging
- Set ACL to restrict export configuration with IAM, Cloud Logging
- Set ACL to allow metric writing for custom metrics with IAM, Cloud Monitoring

### Section 4: Optimizing service performance

#### 4.1 Identify service performance issues:
- Evaluate and understand user impact
- Utilize Google Cloudâ€™s operations suite to identify cloud resource utilization
- Utilize Cloud Trace and Cloud Profiler to profile performance characteristics
- Interpret service mesh telemetry
- Troubleshoot issues with the image/OS
- Troubleshoot network issues (e.g., VPC flow logs, firewall logs, latency, view network details)

#### 4.2 Debug application code:
- Application instrumentation
- Cloud Debugger
- Cloud Logging
- Cloud Trace
- Debugging distributed applications
- App Engine local development server
- Error Reporting
- Cloud Profiler

#### 4.3 Optimize resource utilization:
- Identify resource costs
- Identify resource utilization levels
- Develop plan to optimize areas of greatest cost or lowest utilization
- Manage preemptible VMs
- Utilize committed use discounts where appropriate
- TCO considerations (e.g., security, logging, networking)
- Consider network pricing

### Section 5: Managing service incidents

#### 5.1 Coordinate roles and implement communication channels during a service incident:
- Define roles (incident commander, communication lead, operations lead)
- Handle requests for impact assessment
- Provide regular status updates, internal and external
- Record major changes in incident state (e.g., When mitigated? When is all clear?)
- Establish communications channels (e.g., email, IRC, Hangouts, Slack, phone)
- Scaling response team and delegation
- Avoid exhaustion / burnout
- Rotate / hand over roles
- Manage stakeholder relationships

#### 5.2 Investigate incident symptoms impacting users:
- Identify probable causes of service failure
- Evaluate symptoms against probable causes; rank probability of cause based on observed behavior
- Perform investigation to isolate most likely actual cause
- Identify alternatives to mitigate issue

#### 5.3 Mitigate incident impact on users:
- Roll back release
- Drain / redirect traffic
- Turn off experiment
- Add capacity

#### 5.4 Resolve issues with deployments (e.g., Cloud Build, Jenkins):
