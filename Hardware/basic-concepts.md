# Common Internal Components

Mother/System Board
- The motherboards is what connects everything in the system to everthing else.  It is comprised of connectors for peripheral devices, video cards, power, memory, cpu, hard drives, sound, and network.  

FirmWare/BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
- A form of memory that stores information about a components hardware and it's communication with other computer components.

RAM (Random Access Memory)
- One of the most important parts of a computer's operation.  When a computer is working with items, it is stored in System Memory until it is needed.  RAM allows for quicker communication with the processor.

CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- The CPU executes instructions of a computer.  It performs tasks presented by the program including, math, logic, i/o and control functions.
 - Types
   - ARM 
   - 32-bit
   - 64-bit

Storage
- There are various types of storage to hold ones data.  Most commonly for a computer system it is stored on either a mechanical, spinning HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or a smaller, but faster SSD (Solid State Drive) along with familiar transferable units such as USB Drives or good old fashioned CD/DVDs

GPU (Graphical Processing Unit)
- GPUs are the video cards that come as built-in models or peripheral components.  Most office and even home computers that don't require much in video processing may see a built-in video card where typical gaming computers will see the larger addon cards with their fan units.

Cooling
- Thermal Paste
- Water Cooled
- Heat Sinks
- Fans

Audio Card
- Can be built-on to the motherboard or added as an peripheral component, allowing connection of various sound units such as external speakers and microphones, etc.

NIC (Network Interface Card)
- Computers can have built in network cards, wireless cards or both. They can also have peripheral components.  

Power Supply
- Power Supplies come in different level of strengths to have sufficient power for the devices in the system, including drives, the video card and motherboard.
