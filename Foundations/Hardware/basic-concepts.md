# The Library Comparison

An analogy I created to help non-technical people understand the basic function of computer hardware is "a library."

Motherboard/Case/PowerSupply
- For simplicities sake, these items are being grouped together here.  
- The outside and inside floorplan of the library.  And the power used light it.  It's what connects all the different parts.  

CPU
- In this particular analogy, you as a person are the processor. You do all the work.  If you have a team, you are more of a multi-core processor.  It could be said that you are the operating system as well to an extent.  
- As the processor you are the one that goes to the shelves to get your books. Or looks through them on the table so you have room.  You talk to librarians to get a book from another library perhaps.  

Hard Drive
- The shelves that hold the books are themselves the folders on your computer that containers your files.  You go to the bookshelf, get the file/book and return to the table to use it and when you are done, you close it and put it back on the shelf.

Memory
- The table you are working at is the memory.  It's where the things you need to use sit.  The bigger the table, the more room you have and the more files/books you can fit on the table at the same time saving the time from going back and forth to the shelves.

## Common Internal Components

Mother/System Board
- The motherboards is what connects everything in the system to everthing else.  It is comprised of connectors for peripheral devices, video cards, power, memory, cpu, hard drives, sound, and network.  

FirmWare/BIOS (Basic Input/Output System)
- A form of memory that stores information about a components hardware and it's communication with other computer components.

RAM (Random Access Memory)
- One of the most important parts of a computer's operation.  When a computer is working with items, it is stored in System Memory until it is needed.  RAM allows for quicker communication with the processor.

CPU (Central Processing Unit)
- The CPU executes instructions of a computer.  It performs tasks presented by the program including, math, logic, i/o and control functions.
 - Types
   - ARM 
   - 32-bit
   - 64-bit

Storage
- There are various types of storage to hold ones data.  Most commonly for a computer system it is stored on either a mechanical, spinning HDD (Hard Disk Drive) or a smaller, but faster SSD (Solid State Drive) along with familiar transferable units such as USB Drives or good old fashioned CD/DVDs

GPU (Graphical Processing Unit)
- GPUs are the video cards that come as built-in models or peripheral components.  Most office and even home computers that don't require much in video processing may see a built-in video card where typical gaming computers will see the larger addon cards with their fan units.

Cooling
- Thermal Paste
- Water Cooled
- Heat Sinks
- Fans

Audio Card
- Can be built-on to the motherboard or added as an peripheral component, allowing connection of various sound units such as external speakers and microphones, etc.

NIC (Network Interface Card)
- Computers can have built in network cards, wireless cards or both. They can also have peripheral components.  

Power Supply
- Power Supplies come in different level of strengths to have sufficient power for the devices in the system, including drives, the video card and motherboard.
