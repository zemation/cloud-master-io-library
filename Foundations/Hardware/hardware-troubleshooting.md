## Best Practice Hardware Troubleshooting Methodology

Always consider corporate policies, procedures, and impacts before implementing changes.  
- Identify the problem.
 - Gather information from the user, identify user changes, and, if applicable, perform backups before making changes.
 - Inquire regarding environmental changes
- Establish a theory of probable cause (question the obvious)
 - If necessary, conduct external or internal research based on the symptoms
- Test the theory to determine cause
 - Once the theory is confirmed, determine the next steps to resolve the problem
 - If the theory is not confirmed, re-establish a new theory or escalate
- Establish a plan of action to implement the solution
 - Refer to the vendor's instructions for guidance
- Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measure
- Document the findings, actions and outcomes
