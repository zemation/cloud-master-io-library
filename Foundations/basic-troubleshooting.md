## The Troubleshooting Methodology

Identify the Problem
- Gather Information
- Duplicate the problem, if possible
- Question Users
- Identify Symptoms
- Determine if anything has changed
- Approach multiple problems individually

Research knowledge base / internet, if applicable

Establish a theory of probable cause
- Question the obvious
- Consider multiple approaches
 - Divide and Conquer

Test the theory to determine the cause
- Once the theory is confirmed (confirmed ROOT cause), determine the next steps to resolve the problem
- If the theory is not confirmed, establish a new theory or escalate

Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and identify potential effects
Implement the solution or escalate as necessary
Verify full system functionality and, if applicable, implement preventive measures
Document findings / lessons learned, actions, and outcomes
