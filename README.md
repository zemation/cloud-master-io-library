- üëã Hi, This is @cloud-master-io
- üñ•Ô∏è We look to build out a service to offer easy access to notes and documentation to assist in the usage of IT, Cloud, and DevOps Services.
- üìñ I‚Äôm currently learning ... which platofrm to build this out on

We're in the process of building what we hope to be an extensive website for conversation about various topics we cover, question and answer amongst members, recent news about topics etc.

We have 20+ years in the computer industry with Certified Professionals in Microsoft Windows, Linux, and AWS Cloud.  We believe that the education model in IT and Computer systems is broken.  However there are ways to help alleviate that if you know where to look.  

That is with certifications.  Industry Certifications allow you to focus on one subject at a time, without the cost of Post-Secondary tuition and only pay for any resources you get that have price, and the certification (unless you have a company that will purchase voucher)
