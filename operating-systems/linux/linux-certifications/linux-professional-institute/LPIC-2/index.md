##  Abstract

-   Audience:  this book is intended to help people prepare for the LPIC-2
    exam. You will need to have at least 2 years of practical experience
    with Unix, preferably Linux. Though you may take the LPIC-2 exam
    without it, you should be an LPIC-1 alumnus to be allowed to the
    titles and rights that come with the LPIC-2 certification.

-   Approach: We wanted to create a set of documents that could help us
    and others to pass the LPIC-2 exams. This book contains all the
    information (and more) needed to pass the exam.

-   Sources: Our sources of information were partly acquired from material
    on the Internet. Also practical experience of the authors and others
    and research done by the authors are to be credited. We try to give
    credit where due, but are fallible. We apologize.
